    <h2>Understanding Bipolar Disorder</h2>
    <p>
      Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition marked by extreme mood swings that include emotional highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression). 
      These shifts can affect sleep, energy levels, behavior, judgment, and the ability to think clearly.
    </p>

    <h2>Common Symptoms</h2>
    <p>Symptoms depend on the type and phase of the disorder:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Manic episodes:</strong> High energy, reduced need for sleep, grandiose ideas, risky behavior</li>
      <li><strong>Depressive episodes:</strong> Sadness, fatigue, loss of interest, hopelessness, changes in appetite</li>
      <li><strong>Mixed episodes:</strong> Symptoms of both mania and depression at the same time</li>
      <li>Difficulty concentrating or making decisions</li>
      <li>Changes in activity levels or sleep patterns</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Causes and Risk Factors</h2>
    <p>The exact cause isn't fully understood, but several factors may contribute:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Genetic predisposition (family history)</li>
      <li>Brain structure and chemical imbalances</li>
      <li>Traumatic life events or prolonged stress</li>
      <li>Substance abuse or major life changes</li>
      <li>Hormonal or neurological factors</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Treatment Options</h2>
    <p>While there's no cure, bipolar disorder can be managed effectively with the right treatment plan:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Medication:</strong> Mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, or antidepressants under supervision</li>
      <li><strong>Therapy:</strong> Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), talk therapy, or family-focused therapy</li>
      <li><strong>Lifestyle changes:</strong> Maintaining a routine, avoiding alcohol and drugs, managing stress</li>
      <li><strong>Support networks:</strong> Joining support groups or leaning on family/friends for help</li>
      <li><strong>Education:</strong> Learning about the disorder helps with early detection and relapse prevention</li>
    </ul>
