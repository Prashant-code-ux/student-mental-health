    <h2>Understanding OCD</h2>
    <p>
      Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a mental health condition characterized by unwanted, intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors or mental acts (compulsions) aimed at reducing distress or preventing feared events.
      These obsessions and compulsions can significantly interfere with daily life.
    </p>

    <h2>Common Symptoms</h2>
    <p>OCD symptoms are typically categorized into two areas:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Obsessions:</strong> Repeated, persistent, and unwanted thoughts, urges, or images (e.g., fear of contamination, doubts, aggressive thoughts)</li>
      <li><strong>Compulsions:</strong> Repetitive behaviors or mental rituals performed to ease anxiety (e.g., handwashing, checking, counting)</li>
      <li>Excessive worry about order, symmetry, or precision</li>
      <li>Distress when routines are disrupted</li>
      <li>Time-consuming rituals that interfere with daily functioning</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Causes and Risk Factors</h2>
    <p>The causes of OCD are complex and may involve several factors:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Genetic factors and family history</li>
      <li>Brain structure and functioning, particularly in areas linked to anxiety and decision-making</li>
      <li>Imbalances in neurotransmitters such as serotonin</li>
      <li>History of childhood trauma or abuse</li>
      <li>Environmental stressors or infections (e.g., PANDAS in children)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Treatment Options</h2>
    <p>OCD can be effectively managed with a combination of therapies and support:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Therapy:</strong> Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), especially Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP)</li>
      <li><strong>Medication:</strong> Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are commonly prescribed</li>
      <li><strong>Lifestyle adjustments:</strong> Mindfulness, stress management, regular routines, and sleep hygiene</li>
      <li><strong>Support groups:</strong> Connecting with others experiencing OCD can provide relief and encouragement</li>
      <li><strong>Education:</strong> Learning about OCD can help reduce stigma and improve coping strategies</li>
    </ul>
